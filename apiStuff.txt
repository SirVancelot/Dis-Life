Master: TCP
Accepts connection
Takes in 8 ports to be used for udp stuff
Immediately sends 8 neighbor addresses and ports to be used (based on direction)
Canonical order:
1 2 3
4   5
6 7 8
Also sends row and column

Client: UDP
Sets input state somehow (from user)
Connects to master
Sends 8 ports to be used (1 per direction)
Get 8 neighbor addresses/ports
close connection with master
// Send each neighbor a direction (where we are in relation to them as a number 1-8)  <-- no longer necesssary
Start simulating!
neighbor can see our port and address from our udp packet when we send to them, they can update their neighbors if we are new

Grid sending:
grid is n by n
Diagonal case - send 1 bit
Nondiagonal case - send n bits (left to right or up to down)
Both cases: append timestamp to message OR NOT

What should our timeout be? based on tick window
How long should our ticks be? .5-1 second for starters
